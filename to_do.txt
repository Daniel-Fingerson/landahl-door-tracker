write it so that it will write to an SQL file with two inputs:

How long to keep the LED running, the other with the time it was inputed

Have the webpage not intitally output 1 0r 0

Rather, have it ouput the state of whatever the file says/ dont if theres enough of a gap in time

If we want to/can decide on patterns, I can have another input that will pick what sort of pattern to blink

cd to current directory
sqlite3 LEDstate.db
begin;
create table LEDstate (Cminute numeric, duration numeric, name text);
insert into LEDstate values (datetime(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),15," ");
commit;
.exit

have a post that reads back to the user the input page

have it send a text to landahl
